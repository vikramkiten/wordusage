Python web project
This basic python project retrieves the sentences from the database by accepting the input from the user.
This is a simple website  build using flask as the server
I have used jinja template engine to insert values in the webpage
I have also provided extra python files to demonstrate the parsing the text ,inserting into the MongoDB,retrieving from the database.
i did not emphasize on the front end of the website
